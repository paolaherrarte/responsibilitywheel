# responsibilitywheel

The responsibility wheel was created to faciliate the nightly responsibilities between my husband and I. I felt that it would be useful for responsibilities to be chosen randomly for us. 

I used HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS. 

I utilized math.random function in js to randomize the options.
